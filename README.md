# Basic
This repository contains examples and explanations of the basics of C++ programming, including printing "Hello, World!" and performing basic operations. This README provides an overview of how to get started with C++ programming.

Hello World
Printing "Hello, World!" is a common starting point in C++ programming. You can achieve this using the cout object from the iostream library:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

Operations
C++ supports various basic operations, including arithmetic operations, variable declaration, and assignment. Here are some examples:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Variable declaration and initialization
    int x = 10;
    int y = 5;

    // Arithmetic operations
    int sum = x + y;
    int difference = x - y;
    int product = x * y;
    int quotient = x / y;
    int remainder = x % y;

    // Output the results
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Difference: " << difference << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Remainder: " << remainder << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
